## Use to find edges of throttle dead band.

import pigpio
import time
import EncoderTest
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO


## How To:
##
## 1. Enter the following command in Command Line: sudo pigpiod
## 2. Conenct ESC to Motor, battery, and RPi PWM; secure motor (e.g. vice grip).
## 3. Estimate starting speed; set speed to that guess in FIXME1.
##      7.6 is a good start for forward; 7.4 for reverse
## 4. Choose direction and precision.  Update FIXME2:
##      Change sign to + for forward, - for reverse.
##      0.01 is a good starting precision; decrease on each iteration.
## 5. Run script (Python 2).
## 6. Turn ESC on.  Wait for *Ring* + Beep-Beep + *Ring* *Ring*.
##      *Ring* is 4 Descending Tones
## 7. Press enter in shell to continue.
## 8. Wait until motor begins to turn; make note of minimum speed before it turns
##      If performing more iterations for increased precision, use this value
##      as the new guess in FIXME1.
## 9. Repeat with greater precision until satisfactory precision is achieved.
